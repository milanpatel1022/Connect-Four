# Connect-Four

•	Implemented connect four so that you can play either standalone or via a network
•	The network version connects to a server that allows you to play against an artificial intelligence
•	Server and artificial intelligence were provided by my professor
•	Introduced me to the use of sockets, the importance of protocols and modular programming
